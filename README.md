# Ultrasonic-Security-System

This project is an Arduino Uno-based alarm system that uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to detect nearby objects. The system triggers an LED alarm based on distance:

If an object is ≤ 15 cm, the LED blinks as a warning.

If an object is > 15 cm, the LED stays ON.

The system is useful for security alerts, object detection, and automation projects. The code is written in C++ (Arduino IDE) and can be tested using Tinkercad or real hardware.

Features:
✔️ Uses HC-SR04 for accurate distance measurement.
✔️ D2 LED output for alerting based on distance thresholds.
✔️ Simple and efficient Arduino code with easy modifications.
✔️ Can be expanded for buzzer alerts, LCD display, and more.

Next Steps:
Clone the repository and upload it to an Arduino Uno.

Test the system in Tinkercad or a real-world setup.

Modify the code to add more outputs (e.g., buzzers, relays).
