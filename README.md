## **Ultrasonic Distance-Based Alarm System**  

This project is an **Arduino Uno-based alarm system** that uses an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** to detect nearby objects. The system triggers an **LED alarm** based on distance:  

<ul>
  <li>If an object is ≤ 15 cm, the LED blinks as a warning.</li>
  <li>If an object is > 15 cm, the LED stays ON.</li>
</ul>  

The system is useful for **security alerts, object detection, and automation projects**. The code is written in **C++ (Arduino IDE)** and can be tested using **Tinkercad or real hardware**.

### **Features**:
<ul>
  <li>✔️ Uses HC-SR04 for accurate distance measurement.</li>
  <li>✔️ D2 LED output for alerting based on distance thresholds.</li>
  <li>✔️ Simple and efficient Arduino code with easy modifications.</li>
  <li>✔️ Can be expanded for buzzer alerts, LCD display, and more.</li>
</ul>

### **Next Steps**:
<ul>
  <li>🔹 Clone the repository and upload it to an Arduino Uno.</li>
  <li>🔹 Test the system in Tinkercad or a real-world setup.</li>
  <li>🔹 Modify the code to add more outputs (e.g., buzzers, relays).</li>
</ul>
